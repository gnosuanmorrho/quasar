## What is Alien vs Predator Multiplayer?
 
Alien vs Predator is a first-person shooter game developed by Rebellion and published by Sega in 2010. It is based on the popular crossover film series that pits two of the most iconic sci-fi creatures against each other and humans. The game features three separate single-player campaigns, one for each species, that have different gameplay styles and objectives. The alien campaign focuses on stealth and agility, the predator campaign on hunting and gadgets, and the marine campaign on survival and firepower.

The game also offers a multiplayer mode that supports up to 18 players online or via LAN. There are seven multiplayer modes to choose from, such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, infestation, predator hunt, survivor, domination, and mixed species deathmatch. Each mode has different rules and objectives that require teamwork and strategy. For example, in infestation mode, one player starts as an alien and tries to infect other players who are marines. The last marine standing wins. In predator hunt mode, one player is a predator and has to kill as many marines as possible before time runs out or he is killed.
 
## What are the Problems with Alien vs Predator Multiplayer?
 
Despite being a fun and thrilling game, Alien vs Predator has some issues that prevent some players from enjoying it fully. One of the most common problems is that the multiplayer server list does not show any servers or shows only a few servers that are either full or empty. This makes it hard to find a match or join a game with other players. Another problem is that the game crashes on Windows 10 when launching or playing. This can be frustrating and annoying for players who want to play the game without interruptions.
